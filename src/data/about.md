# Intro

I am a recent graduate of the University of Kentucky, College of Engineering. I orginally was going to do mission work after college, but changed my plans during my senior year. (There were a lot of reasons for this, but if you are interested, please message me.) With the recent change of plans, my time and focus went into increasing my knowledge of software. I put a lot of effort into making sure I was carrer ready for the industry, and thankfully all that time and focus payed off.  I still have not lost my main focus, however, of wanting to go back overseas for mission work (hopefully through the [IMB](https://www.imb.org/)), but my path to get there changed and I am super thankful for all the different ways I have grown through that change. 

# What I'm currently learning

At Papa Johns International, I've been able to have an amazing first experience out of college. Some of the tech that I've been diving into most: Spring Boot, Gradle, Jenkins, Google Cloud, and a lot of other major corporate tech that I never got to experience in college. So far, it's been a great experience and a lot of my co-workers and the higher up engineers have been quite impressed with how quickly I have been able to catch on and contribute at the same level as them. Overall, I'm super eager to keep diving into new systems, repos, and tech.

# Some history in tech

- Before getting my first computer, I would get on my parents Dell PC - running Windows XP - primarily to play games. Haven't really touched an older computer since (besides my grandma's Dell running Windows Vista)

- When I was 8 I got my first computer, a Macbook (original - 2006). I didn't quite use it to th ebest of its ability, but as a 10 year old with a Macbook, I was really able to get the hang of Mac OS (X Leopard to be precise)

- Finally gained a good understanding of a computer's true use when I was 13. Learning Excel in computer class actually was the breakpoint for me when it came to finding an interest in how technology shapes around our lives and even vise-versa.

- Up until my senior year of highschool, I was quite focused on other work away from learning about technology, but I had a continued love of how it worked in ever part of our lives. I really wanted to learn how I could make a difference on others lives by the way I can shape the use of software.

- When I was 17 I took my first coding class, never knew that learning Java would still be my primary focus even after college, but that class gave me a huge advantage when I started to take Computer Science(CS) courses.

- From 18 to 22, earned my CS degree at the University of Kentucky and also learned of my passion for coffee. During this time, I made my first website in HTML/CSS/Javascript for a ministry I was really involved with, [UKPray](https://www.ukpray.com). (Assuming this is still up, it looks best on Chrome)

- Age 21 to Present(22), completed my my capstone project for Papa Johns International. I made a driver delivery app which inspired a modern day application and was offered to work with them as a contractor.
